# Impedance Control on da Vinci Research Kit Patient Side Manipulator (PSM)
This package contains MATLAB code that shows the work done for the RBE501 Robot Dynamics Course Final Project.

This code package has three sub-packages, each with its own ReadMe file.

There are three folders 

1. \Impedance_Control_Code_R2012a\

2. \Impedance_Control_Code_R2015a\

3. \Inverse_Kinematics_PSM_R2012a\

The first folder \Impedance_Control_Code_R2012a\ contains code related to the Impedance Control model developed for the da Vinci PSM. 
The code in this file was developed in MATLAB R2012a.

The second folder \Impedance_Control_Code_R2015a\ contains code related to the Impedance Control model developed for the da Vinci PSM. 
The code in this file was developed in MATLAB R2012a but was also tested and modified to be compatible to run with MATLAB R2015a.

The third folder \Inverse_Kinematics_PSM_R2012a\ contains the code for the Inverse Kinematics of the da Vinci PSM.
The code in this file was developed in MATLAB R2012a and was tested to work in MATLAB R2015a.

Every folder has a MAIN.m file that can be run to obtain results as explained in the project final report.
