This file gives info about the flow of the MATLAB script files in this package.
All script files in this package were developed in MATLAB R2012a and have been made compatible in MATLAB R2015a.
However, the speed of execution may be slow in MATLAB R2015a as the testing of this code was done only in the 
MATLAB in the Remote Desktop of WPI and execution was found to be slow.

proper_lagrangian_PSM.m
    Dependencies:   None.
    Output      :   This file generates the symbolic torque vector using the Euler-Lagrange approach.
    Notes       :   This torque vector is saved to a file named 'taus.mat'.
    
coeffs_Lagr.m
    Dependencies:   This file uses the 'taus.mat' file generated in the proper_lagrangian_PSM.m file.
                    It loads it directly to memory, thereby eliminating the need to calculate the 
                    torque vector symbolically every time.
    Output      :   This file generates the M(q) matrix, C(q,qdot)*qdot vector and G(q) vector.
    Notes       :   These variables, M,Cqdot and G are saved to a file named 'MCG.mat'.
    
MAIN.m

    Dependencies:   The MAIN.m file uses the 'MCG.mat' file generated by the coeffs_Lagr.m file.
                    It loads it directly to memory, thereby eliminating the need to calculate the 
                    dynamics matrix/vectors symbolically every time.
                    It is also dependent on the callback functions for the slider and button operations
                    specifically, the files 'cb_txtupdate.m', 'cb_interactive_IMP.m', 'cb_conf.m'
    Output      :   Running this file outputs all plots.
    Notes       :   This file takes 0.35 to 0.7 seconds for each iteration to execute and the total
                    iterations is 601.
